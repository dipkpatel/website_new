                                    <p><b>W</b><b>HO WE ARE</b><b>:</b></p>
                                    <p>Yorklands Green Hub (YGH) is a non-partisan citizens group that promotes the repurposing of part of the former Guelph Correctional Centre (GCC), and transforming this heritage site within the City of Guelph into a public “Ontario Sustainable Environments Centre.”</p>
                                    <p>Our group formed in May 2013 when we learned of the provincial initiative to consider proposals for adaptive reuse or development of the GCC lands and buildings. An initial proposal to our MPP, the Hon. Liz Sandals, who supports our vision, tasked us to gauge public support for the idea. To date, over 2,500 individuals have signed a petition as supporters, and more than 40 provincial and local groups have given us their official endorsement of our vision.</p>
                                    <p>

                                    <p><b>O</b><b>UR GOAL</b><b>:</b></p>
                                    <p>We envision repurposing 47 acres of the heritage land and one building on this provincially owned unused property to create an active green hub. This centre, created for Ontario’s public domain, will be a self-sustaining education, demonstration, innovation and research hub that will focus on sustainable local food production, wise water use &amp; wetland protection, as well as heritage and energy conservation and renewable energy technologies.</p>
                                    <p>The site will bring together businesses, organizations, and people of all ages to work, learn, and innovate with the common purpose of being engaged stewards of our land, food, water, and energy resources. It is an ideal site to provide work space, indoor and outdoor displays, rotating exhibits, workshops, lectures, videos and educational materials that promote greater understanding of sustainable living.</p>
                                    <p>The former superintendent’s house on the property will be used as a demonstration and education centre presenting food, water and energy alternatives to move our communities towards carbon neutrality. The site will host busloads of students, tourists and other interested groups allowing them to engage first-hand with sustainable environmental initiatives and integrate them into their own lives. Our green hub will stress the importance of innovation and change that will lead to reduced carbon emissions, mitigation of climate change, and an overall increase in public education with respect to our environment in the 21st century.</p>
                                    <p>At this time of great concern regarding food and water security, the Yorklands Green Hub vision aligns with the goals of public education, public health, sustainable urban agriculture (as outlined in the Ontario Local Food Act), and the carbon neutrality goals of Guelph&#8217;s Official Plan and provincial goals of sustainability for energy, water and food production.</p>

                                    <p>In October, 2013 YGH submitted an Expression of Interest to Infrastructure Ontario to request long term lease of a 47 acre parcel of the GCC which is currently designated as “adaptive reuse” and a “significant natural area” as outlined in the Guelph Innovation District plan. This access would include sole use of the superintendent’s house, and partnered use of the GCC Administration building. Our goal is to create a provincial exhibition and work site that brings forward a living history of its reform-inspired past. It will illuminate best practices of today&#8217;s environmental innovation and promotion while appreciating the site’s rich indigenous, natural and cultural heritages. In November, 2014 we were informed by Infrastructure Ontario that the GCC lands would only be disposed of through a sale of assets.</p>
                                    <p>Yorklands is now planning to raise $3 million to purchase the land, the superintendent&#8217;s house, and to retrofit that building.</p>
