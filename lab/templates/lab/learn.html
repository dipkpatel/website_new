					<h1>Why the need to Learn?</h1>
					<h2>
						<p>The Yorklands Eco Learning Lab is a classroom on wheels whose mission is to educate, demonstrate and inspire youth to live more sustainably. We accomplish this through grade-appropriate activities and lessons. Students explore these themes and solve problems through collaboration with their peers to help create a more sustainable future. 

						</p>
					</h2>
					<p>
						If we can get kids and students excited about clean energy, then they are the ones who will keep the push for sustainable living strong in the upcoming decades. Our curriculum will engage students at every grade level to make the experience engaging and informative to them. The curriculum for the Yorklands Eco Learning Lab encourages students to take the information on sustainable living home to their friends and families to start making their homes and communities more sustainable. By addressing the needs of water, waste, food and energy in a local and global scale, our curriculum does its best to address the learning needs of students of all ages to make sure everyone can get involved, and that everyone will find a reason that environmental learning is a critical idea for the future.

				<div id="sec1"> 
					<h1>Energy</h1>
					<h3>
						<p>Where does energy come from? How are we generating energy now? Is there enough energy now for everyone? Is it safe? What is the cost of using that kind of power source to create energy? Children will explore different ways that energy can be generated from non-renewable and renewable resources.
						</p>	
					</h3>
					<h2>Our Mission:</h2>
					<h3>
						<p>
							Our unit on energy can serve to introduce energy to young students their daily lives. This includes energy in humans, electricity in daily lives, and renewable forms of energy.

							Activity and motion are a great way to introduce energy and active learning to young students, and our goal is to engage the students and encourage them to begin to think about the world around them. The students will be given a chance to see energy in action, talk about how everyone, including the students, need energy to feel active and healthy, and how the world has a bunch of different types of energy which we can use, some of which are much better for the environment.

				<div id="sec2"> 
					<h1>Food</h1>
					<h3>
						<p>We all like to eat. But do you know where your food came from? How was it produced? Is that having a negative impact on the environment or on the people who grow it? Through the interactive activities and opportunities the lab provides we will demonstrate to future generations the potential we have to create a more sustainable food system.
						</p>	
					</h3>
					<h2>
						Our Mission:
					</h2>
					<h3>
						<p>
							To nourish the minds of the future generation, the food-based curriculum is set in place to teach students about food sustainability and security. Students will be challenged to think about why and how we process, preserve, and grow food to limit detrimental effects to the environment while feeding the growing population. The Y.E.L.L drives home the idea that what YOU do with food will impact your. 
						</p>
					</h3>
					<h2>Ex. Grade 5-6</h2>
					<h3>
						<p>

							Grade 5 and 6 students will be introduced to core concepts of food security and food sustainability through a series of challenges and demonstrations. Methods to demonstrate local food sustainability will encourage students to think of consuming fresh produce according to the season, to grow self sufficient fruits or vegetables at home, and food processing techniques to reduce waste and increase storability (or time in storage). To get students thinking on a larger scale, the benefits and downfalls of food processing in relation to food security will be explored.  Challenges will include team problem solving activities that awards points as incentives. These team challenges will involve a design component and a quizzing component.

					<h2>Sample Activity</h2>
					<h3>
						<p>

							Option 1: Fruit rehydration: comparison of Fresh green bean, dehydrated green bean, rehydrated green bean

						</p>
					</h3>
					<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
						<h3>
							<li>Discuss the different storage times and storage location (temperature) required for each food variation. </li>
							<li>This is Dehydrating is one of the many ways which food is processed to feed a growing population.  We as a developed country do not necessarily need to eat these types of foods because we have other means of obtaining fresh foods.  We need to learn how to properly keep foods to prevent food waste. </li>
							
						</h3>						

					</ul>
					    	<h3>
						<p>
							Option 2: Plant growing: Grow your own vegetables and herbs in the plant drawers. 
						</p>
					</h3>

			<h1>Waste</h1>
			<h3>
				<p>Waste is more than just the litter on the ground. All the stuff we throw in the garbage ends up somewhere. What can we do to reduce our waste? Let’s explore this together!      
				</p>

			</h3>
			<h2>
				Our Mission:
			</h2>
			<h3>
				<p>Depending on the theme for the year, third and fourth grade students will have the chance to expand on knowledge already taught in classes from the Ontario curriculum. Topics discussed will expand ‘introductory’ ideas learned in previous years, and begin to ask students to apply this knowledge to their real life (the use of plastics in items at home or school, how they can be reused, etc.). More in-depth concepts regarding recycling will also be taught (composting, specifically) as the outdoor-aspect within this unit.</p>
			</h3>
		</div> 
		<div id="sec4"> 
			<h1>Water</h1>
			<h3>
				<p>The water curriculum is designed to educate students about the necessity of water conservation and reuse. It will demonstrate the value of existing technologies such as grey water reuse systems and rainwater harvesting systems. 
				</p>
			</h3>
			<h2>Our Mission</h2>
			<h2>Ex. Grade 7-8</h2>
			<h3>
				<p>
					Grade 7-8 students will investigate the role of water in Earth’s ecosystems, and how humans and animals use it in different ways. They will gain an understanding of how water pollution occurs, and why we must work to prevent it, as it is very difficult to reverse the effects of pollution. Students will engage in hands-on activities that will further their understanding of biotic and abiotic components in ecosystems.
